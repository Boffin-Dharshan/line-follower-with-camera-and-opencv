# line-follower-with-camera-and-opencv
A camera-based line follower robot built with ROS2, Gazebo, and OpenCV. Instead of IR sensors, the robot uses a camera to detect and follow a track. Includes a 4-wheel differential drive, a custom Gazebo world with a rectangular loop, and OpenCV scripts for real-time vision-based navigation.
